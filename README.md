### DoodleTester

This project uses `Cucumber JVM` to test drive `doodle.com`. It is used in my Testing Classes. You need to have Firefox installed.

Start with 

```
./gradlew cucumber
```

To import into your IDE use

```
./gradlew idea
```

or

```
./gradlew eclipse
```

There are three branches:

  * `step1`: This is an empty skeleton for creating your test
  * `step2`: This is an naive approach for scripting your test
  * `step3`: This approach is better, because the test script is much better to read an better to understand the intent of the test
